** [#A] Mikrokosmos
Mikrokosmos is a lambda calculus interpreter.

*** TODO Implement type theory http://www.cse.chalmers.se/%7Ebengt/papers/GKminiTT.pdf
*** TODO Implement simply-typed lambda calculus with products and a terminal type
It is the language of CCCs.
It can be showed that it is strongly normalizable.

*** TODO Implement Hindley-Milner or System F
System F has no decidable inference, you have to write more.
Hindley-Milner does not allow for types on quantifiers.

System F and the Girard-Reynolds isomorphism seem like great ideas.

*** TODO [#C] Multiple lines on modules
Multiple line notation should be allowed by joining multiple lines whenever
they start with a <TAB> or a space.
*** TODO Write tests
*** TODO Should Multibimap be a package on its own?
*** Compile to categories
*** Seminars about mikrokosmos
*** Dependent types
http://math.andrej.com/2012/11/08/how-to-implement-dependent-type-theory-i/
*** Write a pygments lexer
http://pygments.org/docs/lexerdevelopment/

*** Emacs theme
*** Logo background should be a "cosmos" background
*** DONE [#A] Module system
The module system is being written.

I should first find every module I have to load and, only then,
load all of them in a single command.

Every module should have a list of DEPENDENCY directives.
*** DONE [#B] Jupyter kernel
[[https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/development/kernels.html][Making kernels for IPython]]
[[http://andrew.gibiansky.com/blog/ipython/ipython-kernels/]]
*** WONTFIX Change notation
In order to avoid confusions with types

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
:load -- !load
qwer != asdf -- qwer ?= asdf
#+END_SRC

*** WONTFIX Use a .mikrokosmos config file
Is it really necessary?

*** WONTFIX Config files
A simply typed mikroskosmos would be great for writing configuration files.

*** WONTFIX compiling mikrokosmos
It could be compiled to C.

*** WONTFIX Write a compiler
Maybe a compiler would work better than an interpreter.

*** WONTFIX Optimizing mikrokosmos in Agda
It seems very difficult to write a mikrokosmos interpreter on Agda.

*** WONTFIX [#C] The IO problem
How to declare an imperative - Wadler

**** syscall proposal
***** Output
#+BEGIN_SRC 
#printNum (\s.\z.(s (s z)))
#+END_SRC

printNum.hs
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
num :: Lambda -> Int
num Nil = 0
num (Lambda x s) = 1 + printnum s

main :: IO ()
main = do
  l <- read :: Lambda
  print $ printnum l
  return ()
#+END_SRC

***** Input
#+BEGIN_SRC
#readNum ()
#+END_SRC

**** syscall with literals
Add a "literal" type.

***** Output
#+BEGIN_SRC mikrokosmos
churchLiteral n = n (\k . syscall ("increment.sh" k)) "0"
printLiteral l = syscall2 ""
#+END_SRC

***** Input
It would use =$= as an antiliteral. Any string started on =$= would be interpreted as
a lambda term.

#+BEGIN_SRC mikrokosmos
readChurch = syscall "readChurch"
#+END_SRC

=readChurch= would return something as ="@(\s.\z.s (s (s z)))"=. Two literals applied one
over thw other would be reinterpreted as their concatenation.
** [#C] Write articles
*** TODO Adjoint functors post
*** TODO Church-Rosser post
*** TODO Wikipedia article Church-Rosser

The kinds of typed lambda calculi.
http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/esslli/esslli-1.pdf

A typed lambda calculus in which the user can set the base types
and its constants. If we add products and a terminal type, this is
the language of cartesian closed categories; and a fragment of
intuitionistic logic called minimal logic.

More precisely, there exist functors between the category of Cartesian
closed categories, and the category of simply-typed lambda theories.

Not making assumptions about the type gives us something that behaves
like type variables.
